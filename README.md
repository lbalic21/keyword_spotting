# Command Recognizer for ESP32-S3

![ESP32-S3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-ESP32--S3-blue) ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C++-red) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen)

## 📌 Overview
Command Recognizer is a lightweight and efficient keyword spotting (KWS) system designed for the ESP32-S3. It processes audio input, extracts MFCC features, and runs inference on a neural network to detect commands and trigger predefined actions.

## ✨ Features
- 🚀 **Efficient Audio Command Recognition**: Detects and executes commands based on neural network inference.
- 🎛 **Customizable Command Set**: Easily add and manage multiple commands.
- ⏳ **Cool-Down Mechanism**: Prevents rapid re-triggering of commands.
- ⚡ **Optimized for ESP32-S3**: Lightweight and performant for embedded systems.
- 📡 **Low-Latency Execution**: Immediate response upon detecting a valid command.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
- **Neural Network**: Install Python dependencies in `neural_network/`
  ```sh
  cd neural_network
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Microcontroller**: Follow the ESP-IDF installation guide for ESP32-S3 [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/get-started/index.html).

### 3️⃣ Build & Flash to ESP32-S3
```sh
cd microcontroller
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build flash monitor
```

## 🚀 Neural Network Training

### 📌 Overview
The neural network processes spectrograms of recorded audio and learns to classify them into predefined commands.

### 🛠 Dataset Preparation
Place your dataset in `dataset/`. Ensure it is structured correctly with labeled audio files.

### 🔧 Training the Model
Run the following command to train the model:
```sh
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
```

### 📤 Model Export
After training, the model will be saved in `model/`. Convert it for ESP32 deployment using:
```sh
python export_model.py --model model/best_model.h5 --output model/tflite_model.tflite
```

## 🚀 Microcontroller Implementation

### 📌 Overview
The microcontroller captures audio, extracts MFCC features, and runs inference using the trained CNN model.

### 🛠 Setup & Installation

#### 1️⃣ Set Up ESP-IDF
Follow the [ESP-IDF installation guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/get-started/index.html) to install the development environment.

#### 2️⃣ Build & Flash Firmware
Navigate to the `microcontroller/` directory and run:
```sh
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build flash monitor
```

#### 3️⃣ Deploy the Model
Copy the converted TFLite model (`tflite_model.tflite`) into `models/` before flashing.

### 🚀 Running Inference
The recognizer processes audio and detects commands in real-time. If a command's probability exceeds `ACTIVATION_THRESHOLD`, it triggers an action.

## 📄 TODOs & Improvements
- [ ] Improve dataset preprocessing
